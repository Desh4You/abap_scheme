LISP interpreter in ABAP

After reading Conrad Barski's <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a> I was curious to understand Martin Ceronio's 
<a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2015/06/24/a-lisp-interpreter-in-abap/">LISP interpreter in ABAP</a>.

This project started as a fork of https://github.com/mydoghasworms/abap-lisp. I converted the regression tests to ABAP Unit and added validations, an editor and more <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Scheme</a> features, so this is now a simple Scheme interpreter with ABAP integration. 

The current version was tested on ABAP Netweaver 7.50 and can be cloned with <a href="http://docs.abapgit.org/">ABAP GIT</a>. For an older version, check the <a href="https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/Snippets/Lisp+Interpreter+in+ABAP">SCN Code Gallery</a>.
