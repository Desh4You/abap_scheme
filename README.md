LISP interpreter in ABAP

After reading Conrad Barski's <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a> I was curious to understand Martin Ceronio's 
<a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2015/06/24/a-lisp-interpreter-in-abap/">LISP interpreter in ABAP</a>.

I converted the regression tests to ABAP Unit and then added features and a better editor. As I learned more about <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Scheme</a>, this is now a Scheme interpreter. The current version was tested on ABAP Netweaver 7.50 and can be cloned with <a href="http://docs.abapgit.org/">ABAP GIT</a>. For an older version, check the <a href="https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/Snippets/Lisp+Interpreter+in+ABAP">SCN Code Gallery</a>.
