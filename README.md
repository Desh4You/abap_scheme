Scheme interpreter in ABAP with Editor

After reading Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp http://landoflisp.com/ I was curious to understand Martin Ceronio's LISP interpreter in ABAP
https://blogs.sap.com/2015/06/24/a-lisp-interpreter-in-abap/.

I converted the regression tests to ABAP Unit and then added features and a better editor. As I learned more about Scheme, so this is now more of a Scheme interpreter.
